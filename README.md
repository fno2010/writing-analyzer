# Writing Analyzer

> A components based analyzer for English research writing.

## Introduction

Hey, guys! I am going to build this project for simplifying the research paper analysis. It is a side product from the "Academic English Writing" course taught in Tongji University. And the target of this course is to teach the Master and PhD. candidate students how to write good research articles in English.

If we introduce the formula of the research article quality as:

![Q = V + P + S](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=Q%20%3D%20V%20%2B%20P%20%2B%20S&bc=White&fc=Black&im=png&fs=16&ff=mathdesign&edit=0)

In this formula,

- ***Q*** - is the quality of the research article
- ***V*** - is the value of the problem
- ***P*** - is the performance of the solution
- ***S*** - is the writing style

We do not really want to discuss about how to find a good problem (***V***) or how to do a good research (***P***). Although there are some general methods and [some people have talked about them](#references). So the remained factor is the writing style: **We just try to propose some guidelines for the writing style.**

The target of this project is to produce some toolkits to help you analyze the writing style of the good research articles in a scientific workflow.

## Standard Workflow for Writing Style Analysis

TBD

## Which Tools We Provide

- [ ] A web spider to fetch the citation from the database.
- [ ] An importer for research articles.
- [ ] An analyzer based on NLP (Natural Language Processing).
- [ ] A statistical report generator.

## How to Use Them

TBD
