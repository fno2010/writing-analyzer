abstract:
  "This article proposes a novel method to perform the genre-based analysis in an efficient way. This method addresses two key challenges in the genre-based analysis of the research articles: (1) The incorrect genre labels conduct the inaccurate analysis result; and (2) the subjective analysis leads the unconfirmed conclusion. The key insight of this method is to perform a recursive probabilistic analysis based on traditional Markov model and association rules learning. In this new method, the ESP researchers can recheck the data collection and get accurate objective result efficiently. This article designs several experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The result of the evaluation shows this method is robust and practical."
